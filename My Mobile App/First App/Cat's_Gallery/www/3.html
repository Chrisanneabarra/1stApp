<b>Chinchilla Personality</b>
<br>
Chinchillas are generally very placid, quiet cats, happy to lie around the home being decorative. They are affectionate, enjoy attention and can become quite attached to their owners.Chinchillas are ideally suited to flats or houses as many prefer to spend much of their day inside. The long white coat does shed a lot of hair which will become worse when the winter coat is dropping. While daily brushing will reduce the amount of hair shed, it will still cover clothes and furniture.</p>
