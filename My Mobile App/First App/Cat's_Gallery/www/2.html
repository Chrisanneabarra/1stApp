<b>British Shorthair Cat - Personality</b>
<br> 
British Shorthair are placid, non demanding, tolerant, docile and respectful. They are not vocal cats and in fact are very quiet and can cope with being alone without fretting. They are not inclined to wander. They love children and get along extremely well with dogs.
