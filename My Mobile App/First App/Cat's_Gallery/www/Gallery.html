    <p>Although many believe the Abyssinian to be direct descendent of the sacred cat of Egypt, the exact origin of the breed is obscure. Certainly, there is a strong resemblance between the modern Abyssinian and the cat depicted in ancient Egyptian bronzes, paintings and the agouti coated cats found buried in the tombs, with the lithe long body large ears and long tail. The Abyssinian shape and distinctive coat however also bears a striking similarly to the African Wild cats. The first registration of the breed appeared in English studbooks in 1896. The earliest identifiable Abyssinian can be found in the Leiden Museum in Holland. The label reads "domestica India", indicating the origin to the same area. More recent studies have indicated the coast of Indian Ocean between Singapore and Ceylon to be the "homeland" of the Abyssinian Tabby colour pattern - Abyssinians are one of the oldest breeds and they are possibly the closest to a natural breed of all the purebred cats in the world.</p>
